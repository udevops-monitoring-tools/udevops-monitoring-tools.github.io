# Monitoring tools for DevOps and microservices
## An interactive web view for an evidence-based choice

Welcome to the Monitoring Tools for DevOps and Microservices website! This platform is designed to help you discover and compare various monitoring tools tailored for DevOps and microservices environments. Our goal is to provide you with detailed information and filtering capabilities to find the perfect tool for your specific needs.

## Filtering Criteria

### General Characteristics

- **Target**: The target system to monitor (e.g., distributed systems, microservices, web services).
- **Data Format**: List of formats to export monitored data (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- **Visualization**: The visualization features offered by the tool (e.g., dashboards, charts, tables).
- **Programming Languages**: The language(s) the tool is programmed with (e.g., Go, Java, Python).
- **Required Tools**: Any additional required and integrable tools to use the monitoring tool effectively (e.g., visualization, DB, data analytics).
- **Assumptions**: Properties that the monitored system should have (e.g., require agent, require specific OS, require instrumentation).

### What is Being Monitored

- **User-Oriented Metrics**: High level, user-oriented metrics (e.g., failure, health, power).
- **System-Oriented Metrics**: Low level, system-oriented metrics (e.g., cpu, memory, networking).
- **Tracing**: Whether the tool supports requests tracing. 
- **Logging**: Whether the tool supports event/failures logging.
- **Quality Attributes**: The quality attribute(s) targeted by the tools (e.g., performance, reliability, security).

### How it is Being Monitored

- **Patterns**: Monitoring patterns implemented by the tool (e.g., health check API, distributed tracing, audit logging).
- **Granularity**: The granularity of the monitored system (e.g., application, microservice, VM/container).
- **Instrumentation Mechanisms**: Information about what instrumentation is required (e.g., vendor-provided platform, vendor-provided library, third-party platform).
- **Integration**: Whether the tool supports integration with testing.
